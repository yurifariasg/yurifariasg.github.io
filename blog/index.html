I hope you enjoy it!</p><h2>Mindset</h2><p>Back in 2012, when I was just starting my career, I heard a piece of advice from a startup founder:</p><blockquote><p>If you feel like you have stopped learning at your job. Maybe it is time to move.</p></blockquote><p>That piece of advice resonates inside my heard since then. During the first module of the MDE, <em>mindset</em>, I learned the benefits and the science behind a life of <strong>constant learning</strong>, and today I see this as one of the most important skills a person could have, and that&#x27;s in every area of life, not just software engineering.</p><p>Constant learning is something <strong>very</strong> hard to achieve when you become overwhelmed, so I prepared a few tips that helped me and I hope it can also help others:</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>Books are typically a no-brainer when you talk about learning. For me, it is a challenge to find a book and be able to finish it. If you find yourself on a similar situation, let me share a few tips that helped me:</p><h4>1. Short reads</h4><p>Look for materials that are short and you can read in 5-10 minutes. I subscribe to a few newsletter that provides me with short reads and keeps me up to date with the news while also providing a good source of information from more experienced professionals.</p><ul><li><a href="https://nodeweekly.com/">Node Weekly</a><ul><li>If you work with NodeJS, that&#x27;s probably the best source of information to keep you up-to-date with the latest on node world.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly</a><ul><li>Also a great resource more generic that covers not only NodeJS but also JavaScript in general. You can typically find here news about web development, ECMAScript, and much more.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://softwareleadweekly.com/">Software Lead Weekly</a><ul><li>Probably one of the best newsletter about Culture, People and Leadership in Software Engineering.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://androidweekly.net/">Android Weekly</a><ul><li>That was the first newsletter of its kind that I started subscribing. Same as the above, but for Android development. I still follow it today, even though, at the moment, I am no longer actively developing Android apps.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a><ul><li>I am not sure you can consider product hunt just a newsletter, but it is definitevely a great source of information about new products and disrupting technologies out there.</li></ul></li></ul><h4>2. Tools</h4><p>Just like in software, the right tooling can help you become even more efficient when learning. The list below outlines a few I use the most:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.onenote.com/">OneNote</a><ul><li>I first used OneNote at adidas together with the Office365 suite. I found fascinating the flexibility to take notes, drawing, moving things around, pasting images and much more. I find it the best note-taking app and I constanty use it to brainstorm and take notes while reading or watching videos.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://app.getpocket.com/">Pocket</a><ul><li>I&#x27;m sure you will find a ton of resources during your research, and most likely you will not have enough time to read them right when you find it. Pocket is an app that allows you to save content for later. It has a mobile app and browser extensions for you to save content anywhere and simply <em>read it later</em>.</li></ul></li><li><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anki-notes/id1388842081">Anki Notes</a><ul><li>That&#x27;s a new gem I found on the internet, and that might be new for you too. Studies shows that repetition is one of the best ways to memorize something. Anki notes is a simple memory app that takes content and shows them to you based on a fancy algorithm to help you memorize them. It works great when you want to remember good quotes from materials you read in the past.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Practice</h2><p>What is learning worth if you don&#x27;t put it to use? As part of MDE we also had the opportunity to learn new things and put them to practice, and in order to share my experience, first, I need to give you some context:</p><p>I currently work on a very complex area of adidas .com website, the Checkout backend. This little part of the whole website gets very complex when you start thinking about different product types, delivery methods, payment methods that can be completely different for every single country. Take that off and you still have a ton of other backend systems that needs to work together. If you think that&#x27;s not enough, just like any other big company, adidas has their own legacy systems that we need to maintain the compatibility.</p><p>Ok, now that you understand the context, I can introduce one of the big challenges of my job as a team lead: How to make people self-motivated? Finding that problem statement was not a easy thing. At first, I thought people simply had no interesting in their work or were simply not willing to do their job, and that was a self-decision where I had no control of. Only after reading some materials and <em>actually</em> exploring the problem, I found out there&#x27;s more to it.</p><h3>What actually motivates people ?</h3><p>Through some materials that you can find, here, here, and here. There&#x27;s a lot about the topic so let met just outlines what I found to be the three main pillars of motivation:</p><ul><li><strong>Can you do it?</strong><ul><li>Understanding of the problem (knowledge) and time, these are essential for people to be motivated to take any work. If they don&#x27;t know what is required of them, they will think twice before taking any decisions.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Will it work?</strong><ul><li>This comes from the <em>belief</em> that what they do, or the plan that they have outlines to solve a problem will actually work. If someone has a plan but they have no belief that that will acomplish what is needed, well... They will also think again...</li></ul></li><li><strong>Is it worth?</strong><ul><li>Worthiness relates a lot to the importance you give to solving a given problem. If you can do it, you know it is going to work, but this doesn&#x27;t bring any value to you, then why should you do it? People need to understand the price that solving this problem brings and it must be worthy.</li></ul></li></ul><p>After reading and understanding all the above I felt like I understood much better the problem and I came up with a first solution to that: <strong>Knowledge Sharing Sessions</strong>.</p><p>Knowledge and understanding of our tech landscape is complex. I work at this same team for two years now and for me it is still complex. Imagine for someone who has just joined the team? Believe me, I am not talking about different technologies.</p><h3>Results</h3><p>The results of these sessions were overwhelmingly surprising. At first it started only with out team of 5-7 people, and while sharing to others teams we work together, the session quickly grew to around 20+ people, some of them I don&#x27;t even know, haha...</p><p>The feedback from that was also very positive, and it soon replicated in other areas. But, what about the initial problem? Well, I wouldn&#x27;t say it was sorted out, but surely I could see that people understood much better the problems had on their hands.</p><h2>Where do we go from here?</h2><p>The application I had used mostly learnings from the MDE program itself, but I am hoping that in the future I can also share experiences from others sources that I shared before or that I will encounter through my career.</p><p>If you have any feedback (good or bad) on this post or you have other hints/tips that could have help me. I&#x27;d love to hear from you!</p><p>I will soon set up a automatic comment section on the site, but for now, please send me an email <a href="mailto:yurifariasg@gmail.com">yurifariasg@gmail.com</a></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
